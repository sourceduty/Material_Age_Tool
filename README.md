[Material Age Tool](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-kGHAa29PA-material-age-tool) was developed to analyze uploaded photos and identify the age of the materials depicted in them. It specializes in estimating how old certain objects or materials are based on visual cues, patterns, and historical knowledge. The tool is particularly useful for users who want to determine the age of antiques, collectibles, or historical artifacts.

To ensure accurate analysis, this GPT follows a step-by-step, multiple-choice questioning process. By guiding the user through a series of specific questions, it gathers relevant details that help narrow down the estimated age range of the material. This method enhances the precision of the tool’s age estimations, making it a reliable resource for enthusiasts and professionals alike.

In addition to estimating the age of materials, the GPT can also provide brief historical context related to the material's era. This added context helps users understand the significance of the item within its historical timeframe, offering a richer understanding of the object’s background and value. The tool is designed to offer clear and focused responses, making it both informative and user-friendly.
